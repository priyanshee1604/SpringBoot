## 🔹 1. **Autowiring in Spring XML Configuration**

Autowiring in Spring allows the container to **automatically inject dependencies** without needing explicit `<property>` tags.

### 🌟 Modes of Autowiring

There are multiple modes, but the common ones are:

### ▶ `autowire="byName"`

* Spring will look for a **bean whose ID matches the name of the property**.
* Only works **if you do not explicitly define a `<property>`** in XML.

#### Example:

```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine; // property name = "engine"
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
}
```

**Beans in XML:**

```xml
<bean id="engine" class="com.example.Engine" />

<bean id="car" class="com.example.Car" autowire="byName" />
```

➡ Since the bean ID `engine` matches the property name `engine`, Spring injects it automatically.

---

### ▶ `autowire="byType"`

* Spring will look for a **bean whose type matches the type of the property**.
* If **multiple beans** of the same type exist, Spring will throw an error (ambiguity).

#### Example:

```xml
<bean id="engine1" class="com.example.Engine" />
<bean id="engine2" class="com.example.Engine" />
<bean id="car" class="com.example.Car" autowire="byType" />
```

❌ Error: Two beans of type `Engine` — Spring doesn't know which one to inject.

---

## 🔹 2. **Primary Bean with `primary="true"`**

To resolve ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type are present, we can mark **one of them as primary**.

```xml
<bean id="engine1" class="com.example.Engine" primary="true" />
<bean id="engine2" class="com.example.Engine" />
```

Now when you autowire by type, Spring will prefer `engine1` because it's marked as primary.

➡ **Note:** `primary="true"` only works **if you don’t explicitly define the `<property>` or inner bean manually**.

---

## 🔹 3. **Lazy Initialization (`lazy-init="true"`)**

By default, Spring eagerly creates all singleton beans **when the container is initialized**. You can override this behavior using `lazy-init`.

### ▶ Eager Initialization (default)

```xml
<bean id="userService" class="com.example.UserService" />
```

➡ Object of `UserService` is created **immediately when container is created**.

### ▶ Lazy Initialization

```xml
<bean id="userService" class="com.example.UserService" lazy-init="true" />
```

➡ Now, the bean will only be created **when it is first requested** (e.g., via `getBean()` or used by another bean).

### ⚠️ Important Caveat:

If a **non-lazy bean** depends on a **lazy bean**, the lazy bean will still be initialized **at container creation time** (because it's needed immediately).

---

## 🔹 4. **Type-safe Bean Retrieval with Overloaded `getBean()`**

Normally, when you retrieve a bean like this:

```java
Object obj = context.getBean("car");
Car car = (Car) obj; // requires type cast
```

You can avoid this cast using the overloaded version:

```java
Car car = context.getBean("car", Car.class); // no type casting needed
```

✔️ This approach is safer and cleaner.

---

## 🔹 5. **`getBean(ClassType.class)` and Primary Selection**

If you retrieve a bean **by type only** and multiple beans exist for that type, Spring will inject the one marked `primary="true"`.

```java
Computer com = context.getBean(Computer.class);
```

➡ The bean marked as primary for `Computer` will be returned.

---

## 🔹 6. **Inner Beans in XML**

Sometimes a bean is used **only inside another bean** and **not reused anywhere else**. In such cases, you can define it as an **inner bean**.

### ▶ Use Case

```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
}
```

### ▶ XML with Inner Bean

```xml
<bean id="car" class="com.example.Car">
    <property name="engine">
        <bean class="com.example.Engine" />
    </property>
</bean>
```

✔️ No separate bean ID needed for `Engine`. It's only visible inside the `Car` bean.

⛔ You can't access this `Engine` bean elsewhere because it **has no ID** and **lives only inside `Car`**.
