## üîÅ Spring Bean Scope: Singleton vs Prototype

### ü§î What happens when you call `getBean()` twice?

By default, when you call `getBean()` multiple times for the same bean in Spring, **you get the same object (bean instance) every time**.

This behavior is controlled by the **scope** of the bean.

## üì¶ Bean Scopes in Spring

Spring supports several types of bean scopes. The most common ones are:

| Scope       | Description                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `singleton` | **Default scope.** Only **one** instance of the bean is created.                   |
| `prototype` | A **new instance** is created **every time** you request the bean via `getBean()`. |
| `request`   | (Web only) One bean per HTTP request.                                              |
| `session`   | (Web only) One bean per HTTP session.                                              |

> Note: Only **`singleton`** and **`prototype`** are part of **Spring Core**.
> The others are available in **Spring Web** and **Spring WebSocket**.

## üßµ Singleton Scope (Default)

When you define a bean in Spring without specifying a scope, it is treated as a **singleton**.

### Behavior:

* Spring creates **only one instance** of the bean **at the time of container initialization**.
* All `getBean()` calls return the **same object reference**.

### Example:

```xml
<bean id="myService" class="com.example.MyService"/>
```

```java
MyService s1 = context.getBean("myService", MyService.class);
MyService s2 = context.getBean("myService", MyService.class);

System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true ‚úÖ
```

## üß¨ Prototype Scope

If you want **a new object** every time you call `getBean()`, use the **`prototype`** scope.

### Behavior:

* Spring creates a **new instance** **every time** `getBean()` is called.
* Unlike singleton, **prototype beans are not created at container startup**, but **on demand**.

### XML Example:

```xml
<bean id="user" class="com.example.User" scope="prototype"/>
```

### Java:

```java
User u1 = context.getBean("user", User.class);
User u2 = context.getBean("user", User.class);

System.out.println(u1 == u2); // false ‚ùå
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Differences Between Singleton and Prototype

| Feature          | Singleton                   | Prototype                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Object Creation  | At container initialization | When `getBean()` is called     |
| Object Count     | One shared instance         | New instance per request       |
| Memory Usage     | Lower (single instance)     | Higher (multiple instances)    |
| Typical Use Case | Shared, stateless services  | Stateful or user-specific data |

## üìù Summary

* By default, Spring uses **singleton scope**, meaning the **same object** is returned every time.
* To get a **new object per call**, use `scope="prototype"` in XML or `@Scope("prototype")` in annotation-based config.
* In **singleton**, the object is created eagerly during container startup.
* In **prototype**, the object is created lazily, **only when `getBean()` is called**.
