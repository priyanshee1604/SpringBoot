## 🧰 Spring Setter Injection (XML-Based)

In Spring, **setter injection** is one of the ways to inject dependencies into a bean.
It uses **setter methods** to inject values into properties.

---

## 📄 How Setter Injection Works

Setter injection is configured in the `XML` file using the `<property>` tag.
Spring does **not directly assign values** to fields. Instead, it **calls the appropriate setter method** on the bean.

There are two kinds of values you might inject:

1. **Primitive values** (e.g., int, String, boolean)
2. **Object references** (e.g., injecting another bean)

---

## 🔢 Injecting Primitive Values

You can inject primitive or literal values using the `value` attribute.

### Example:

Suppose you have a class like:

```java
public class Person {
    private int age;

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

### XML Configuration:

```xml
<bean id="person" class="com.example.Person">
    <property name="age" value="21"/>
</bean>
```

* The `property` tag uses `name="age"` to match the setter `setAge()`.
* Spring will call `setAge(21)` during bean initialization.

---

## 🔁 Injecting Object Dependencies (Bean References)

To inject another bean (object dependency), you use the `ref` attribute instead of `value`.

### Example:

Assume you have a `Car` class that needs an `Engine`:

```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

### XML Configuration:

```xml
<bean id="engine" class="com.example.Engine"/>

<bean id="car" class="com.example.Car">
    <property name="engine" ref="engine"/>
</bean>
```

* Here, `ref="engine"` tells Spring to **inject the bean with ID "engine"** into the `car` bean.
* It will call `car.setEngine(engineBean)` internally.

> ⚠️ The value of `ref` **must match** the `id` of another bean defined in the XML.

## 🧪 Summary

| Type        | Attribute Used | Injected Value | Called Method       |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Primitive   | `value`        | Literal value  | Calls setter method |
| Object/Bean | `ref`          | Bean reference | Calls setter method |

---

## 📌 Key Points

* Setter injection requires **public setter methods** in your class.
* Spring uses reflection to call the setter and **does not modify fields directly**.
* Make sure all referenced beans (`ref`) are defined in the XML with a valid `id`.
